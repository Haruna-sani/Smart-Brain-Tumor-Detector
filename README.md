# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning (ResNet50V2)

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for the classification of brain tumor images using a pre-trained **ResNet50V2** model. The model was fine-tuned to detect and classify brain tumors into three categories: **glioma**, **meningioma (menin)**, and **pituitary tumor**.

## üìå Project Overview

Brain tumor classification from MRI scans is a critical task in the medical domain. This project leverages transfer learning using ResNet50V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to accurately classify MRI scans into tumor types with high precision and recall.

## üß† Classes

The classification task involves the following three tumor classes:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor** (labelled as 'tumor' in the results)

## üöÄ Model Architecture

The core of this model is built on **ResNet50V2** from `tensorflow.keras.applications`. Key modifications and layers added include:

- **GlobalAveragePooling2D**
- **BatchNormalization**
- **Dense layers with ReLU activation**
- **Dropout for regularization**
- **Final Dense softmax layer for classification**

### Key Callbacks Used:
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**
- **EarlyStopping**

## üìä Model Performance

The model achieved impressive results on the test set:
